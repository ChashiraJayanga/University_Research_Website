        <h1> Methodology </h1>

    <p> After having some discussions with our supervisor, co-supervisor and research panel members, requirements 
        were identified, some were changed and finally finalized them. Background and literature survey was done for 
        my component in the area of alerting the people who cross the railway crossings. And then found some
        implementations has been done before which are looks like bit similar world-wide. As it is evident in the 
        literature survey, that there has not been done a specific IT based system to address the safety of people on the 
        road, when they are moving towards a railway crossing and when a train is approaching as well.
        The methodology for creating the proposed train detection and alert system includes the following steps: <br><br>

        1. Literature Survey <br><br>
        2. Data Collecting <br><br>
        3. Model Building <br><br>
        4. Model Testing <br><br>
        5. UI Designing <br><br>
        6. Security Designing <br><br>
        7. Security Testing <br><br>
        8. Integrating <br><br>
        9. Testing <br><br>
        10. Deployment of the Prototype <br><br>
    </p>

    <h2> 1) System Overview </h2> 
    <img src="Images/Screenshot 2023-11-08 155904.png"> <br><br>

    <p> Above figure shows the basic overview of the system. The system incorporates a IoT device with tracking device 
        installed on the train, which transmits its precise location to the IoT device near the railway crossing. When 
        there is a blind spot when the train is moving, that means when the signal is lost, the location of the train is 
        predicted from the machine learning algorithm and transmitted to the IoT device near the railway crossing. 
        Furthermore, the IoT device near the railway crossing is triggered when the train approaches a designated radius 
        near a railway crossing. All the data are transmitted to the cloud database system (Firebase real-time database) 
        from the IoT device near the railway crossing. When a vehicle user who installed our mobile app, is driving 
        towards a railway crossing side and a train is approaching on that particular time as well, alert messages are 
        sent to their mobile app indicating that a railway crossing is approaching and a train is approaching nearby as 
        58
        well, if the mobile application user is inside the range circle. Alert messages are sent as SMS messages to the 
        pedestrians who are near the railway crossing if they are inside the range circle as flooded messages.</p><br><br>

        <h2> 2) Data Collection Process </h2>

        <p>
            Data is collected via the train schedules, train tables to predict the location of the train. Vehicle location, time, 
date and relevant data are collected via the mobile application. The mobile numbers of the users are collected 
when registering to the mobile application. That mobile numbers are used to send normal SMS messages as 
flooded messages as well. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2> 3) Users of the System </h2>

        <p>
            This research effort is primarily aimed at a target audience that crosses the railway crossings, especially the 
people who cross the unsafety railway crossings. Since it is difficult to identify the railway crossings in the 
situations like nights, heavy rains, when there are bends just before the railway crossings; this system is targeted 
for these occasions mainly. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2> 4) The Input of the System </h2>

        <p>
            The vehicle user just needs to download the mobile application and register by providing the mobile number of 
him/her. The mobile application asks the location permission from the mobile to track the location of the vehicle 
user. The mobile user must give the location permission to use the mobile application. 
The pedestrians who are expecting the alert messages as normal SMS messages need to register to the system 
via SMS registration. <br><br>

        </p>

        <h2> 5) The Output of the System </h2>

        <p>
            When the train is near to the railway crossing, the IoT device near the railway crossing is triggered with a sound. 
So, the people near the railway crossing are alerted that a train is approaching nearby.
When the train is approaching towards the railway crossing and the vehicle user who is using the mobile 
application is inside the range circle surrounded by the IoT device near the railway crossing, and if the vehicle 
moving towards the railway crossing, the alert messages are sent to the user via the mobile application that a 
railway crossing is nearby, and a train is approaching.
The people who are near the railway crossing are notified via the flooded SMS messages that train is coming. 
And they are alerted from the prediction as well. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2> 6) UI Designing </h2>

        <img src="Images/Screenshot 2023-11-08 160750.png"> <br><br>

        
        <p>
            Above figure shows some user interfaces of the mobile application. The user should allow location permission when 
using the app since the location of the vehicle user is tracked by the system. The user can log into the application 
if he/she is already registered to the app. If the user is not registered to the app, he/she should register to the app 
by providing necessary details. Since the location permission is granted form user when using the app, the 
vehicle user locations are always tracked by the system to take decisions and alert the user.<br><br>
