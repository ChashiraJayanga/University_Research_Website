        <h1> Research Problem </h1>

    <p class = "Paragraph3"> <b>1. Develop a system that utilizes GSM trackers on trains and IoT devices at railway 
        crossings to predict and alert potential blind spots on the trains. <br><br></b>
        The main research problem addressed by the proposed system that utilizes GSM trackers on trains and IoT 
        devices at railway crossings to predict and alert potential blind spots on the train is the need to enhance railway 
        safety. Despite the implementation of various safety measures, railway accidents still occur, and blind spots on 
        the train remain a significant safety concern. <br><br>
        Blind spots on the train refer to areas where the train driver's vision is obstructed, making it difficult to see 
        potential hazards such as vehicles, pedestrians, or obstacles on the tracks. Blind spots can occur at railway 
        crossings or other areas where the train passes close to buildings or other structures. 
        The proposed system aims to address this problem by utilizing advanced technologies such as GSM trackers and 
        IoT devices to predict and alert potential blind spots on the train. By providing real-time data on train movements 
        and potential hazards, the system can alert railway personnel and train drivers of any potential blind spots and 
        prevent accidents from occurring. <br><br>
        In addition to enhancing railway safety, the proposed system also aims to improve the efficiency of railway 
        transportation. By providing real-time data on train movements and potential hazards, the system can enable 
        railway operators to optimize their operations and improve the efficiency of railway transportation. 
        The research problem addressed by the proposed system can be further broken down into several steps: <br><br><br>
        <b>▪ Step 1: Identifying the safety concerns and blind spots on the train <br><br></b>
        The first step in addressing the research problem is to identify the safety concerns and blind spots on the train. 
        This involves analyzing the various factors that contribute to railway accidents, such as human error, equipment 
        failure, and environmental factors, and identifying the areas where train drivers have limited visibility. <br><br>
        <b>▪ Step 2: Evaluating the effectiveness of existing safety measures </b><br><br>
        The next step is to evaluate the effectiveness of existing safety measures such as automatic train control and 
        positive train control in addressing the safety concerns and blind spots on the train. 
        This involves analyzing the data on accidents and near-misses to identify the areas where safety measures are 
        most effective and areas where further improvements are needed. <br><br>
        <b>▪ Step 3: Exploring the use of advanced technologies </b><br><br>
        The third step is to explore the use of advanced technologies such as GSM trackers and IoT devices to enhance 
        railway safety and address blind spots on the train. This involves researching the potential benefits and 
        drawbacks of using these technologies and identifying the technical requirements and challenges of 
        implementing them. <br><br>
        <b> ▪ Step 4: Developing a system that utilizes GSM trackers and IoT devices <br><br></b>
        The fourth step is to develop a system that utilizes GSM trackers on trains and IoT devices at railway crossings 
        to predict and alert potential blind spots on the train. This involves designing the hardware and software
        components of the system, integrating the system with existing safety measures, and testing the system in a 
        controlled environment. <br><br>
        <b>▪ Step 5: Evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the system <br><br></b>
        The final step is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the proposed system in enhancing railway 
        safety and improving the efficiency of railway transportation. This involves analyzing the data on accidents and 
        near-misses before and after implementing the system and comparing the costs and benefits of implementing the 
        system with other safety measures. <br><br>
        By following these steps, the proposed system that utilizes GSM trackers on trains and IoT devices at railway 
        crossings to predict and alert potential blind spots on the train can effectively address the research problem and 
        enhance railway safety.<br><br><br>

        <b>2. Sending alerts to the users via the app and predicting the likelihood of crossing the 
        railway-crossing on a given day</b><br><br>

        According to Sri Lanka Tweet (2019), Every 3 hours, a person dies from a road accident in Sri Lanka. [4] And 
        also, Every 3 days, a child dies from a road accident in Sri Lanka. According to a study on railway-roadway 
        level crossing safety, which is done by Kulasingham Ragulan and Niranga Amarasingha, there are so many 
        railway crossing collisions happen annually in Sri Lanka. [2]. And also, The ‘datareportal.com’ website shows 
        that Population : Mobile Phone ratio is 1.4 per person in Sri Lanka. [21] That means the total number of phones 
        are greater than the population of Sri Lanka. Even though the count of phones are higher than the population of 
        Sri Lanka, there is no proper ways to use these phones to address the safety of people in Sri Lanka.
        These railway crossing collisions has taken so many human lives as well as lot’s of property damage.<br><br>
        
         Today,there are several web applications and mobile applications about trains in Sri Lanka. But there are no proper IT 
        based solutions to address the safety of people who cross the railway crossings, specially in Sri Lanka.<br><br>

       <b> • How to enhance the safety of passengers and drivers near railway crossings?</b><br><br>

        One of the major research problems addressed by my component is the need to enhance the safety of passengers 
        and drivers near railway crossings. Railway crossings can be dangerous places, and accidents involving vehicles 
        and trains can result in severe injury or even death. My component seeks to address this issue by providing real time message alerts about the approaching trains when a user is coming towards a railway crossing via the app 
        and SMS messages.<br><br>

        <b>• How to provide the predictions with highest accuracy rate?</b><br><br>

        Another research problem to be addressed in my component is the accuracy of vehicle likelihood of crossing the 
        railway crossing when a train is approaching prediction. Inaccurate predictions could lead to mis timely alerts, 
        which could cause passengers and drivers to become desensitized to the warnings provided by the app, resulting 
        in a decreased level of safety. Additionally, the accuracy of vehicle prediction of crossing the railway is critical 
        to the overall effectiveness of the this research project, and any improvements to the accuracy of the system 
        could have a significant impact on the overall safety of railway crossings. Predictions should be made in higher 
        accuracy for better safety of people.<br><br>

       <b> • How to sort the vehicles which are approaching toward the railway crossing? </b><br><br>
        Since we are developing an app to alert the users, it is important to sort the users who are moving toward the 
        railway crossing only. Otherwise, if the alerts are sent every time to the user when a train is approaching, it can 
        be like a headache for the user. That will be a major User experience issue.<br><br>

        <b> • How to develop the mobile application with a better user experience? </b><br><br>

        The app should be a optimized and should be in a simple and attractive UI for a better User Experience. Since 
        we are targeting to commercialize this, the app will play a major rule since it will directly be connected with the 
        user.<br><br>

        <b> • How to integrate with real-time databases? </b><br><br>
        Since the most parts of the whole system connected with a database, it is important to connect them with a real-time database because outputs should be delivered so faster since this address the safety of people. So connecting 
        the component parts with a better real-time database is so much important.<br><br>

        <b> • How to send alert messages not only via the app but also to the SIM card as well?</b><br><br>

        The app user might not use the mobile app due to various reasons. Like whether he/she may turned off the 
        mobile data or his/her 3G or 4G connection’s signal strength is not enough to connect to the internet at the 
        moment. When this kind of scenario happens, it’s important to send alerts to the user somehow.<br><br><br>

        <b>3. Security Analysis for Train Detection and Detecting System </b><br><br>

        <b>Introduction:</b><br><br>
        The railway industry plays a crucial role in the transportation sector, with millions of people and tons of goods 
        transported daily via trains. Train tracking, monitoring, and detection systems are essential components of 
        railway operations that ensure the safety and efficiency of train travel. This paper highlights some research 
        problems that need to be addressed to improve train tracking, monitoring, and detection systems' performance. 
        Every day, millions of people and tonnes of cargo are transported thanks to the railway industry, which is a key 
        pillar of the global transportation sector. The performance of train tracking, monitoring, and detecting systems 
        is crucial for ensuring the efficiency, dependability, and safety of rail traffic. These systems serve as the engine 
        that drives railway operations, ensuring the accurate location and condition of trains, keeping an eye on vital 
        indicators, and spotting any dangers. The continuously changing nature of transportation and technology, 
        however, offers both benefits and difficulties. In order to further improve the functionality of train tracking, 
        monitoring, and detecting systems and eventually contribute to safer and more effective rail travel, this paper 
        explains some important research issues that require attention.<br><br>

        <b> ▪ Problem 1: Developing a reliable real-time train tracking and detection system for low- connectivity 
        environments<br><br></b>

        One of the significant challenges facing train tracking and detection systems is developing a reliable real-time 
        system that can provide accurate and up-to-date train location and schedule information in areas with limited 
        network connectivity. This is particularly challenging for mobile applications that rely on network connectivity 
        to provide real-time information to users. However, many railway lines run through remote or rural areas with 
        poor network coverage, making it difficult to access real-time information about train locations and schedules.
        To address this research problem, researchers need to develop mobile applications that can function effectively 
        in low-connectivity environments, using a range of technologies such as offline caching, edge computing, and 
        satellite communication. These technologies can enable the mobile application to store and access critical 
        information locally, reducing dependence on network connectivity. Developing such an application will help 
        ensure that train operators, cargo handlers, and passengers can access accurate and up-to-date information about 
        train schedules and locations, regardless of their location or network connectivity. This, in turn, will improve the 
        safety and efficiency of train operations, particularly in remote or rural areas where connectivity is limited.<br><br>

        <b>▪ Problem 2: Predicting and managing train delays and disruptions accurately<br><br></b>

        Delays and disruptions are common in train operations, and they can have a significant influence on both train 
        safety and efficiency. Predicting and managing train delays and disruptions accurately is, therefore, another 
        crucial research problem that needs to be addressed to improve train tracking and detection systems.
        To overcome this problem, researchers need to create predictive models that can predict delays and interruptions 
        in real-time using a variety of data sources such as weather, traffic, and train timetables. These models could 
        assist train operators in proactively managing train operations, rerouting trains, and notifying passengers of 
        delays and disruptions, thereby improving safety and efficiency. In addition to prediction models, research is 
        required to develop effective communication and notification systems capable of informing train operators, 
        freight handlers, and passengers about delays and disturbances in real-time. These systems could leverage a 
        variety of communication channels, such as cellphone notifications, SMS messaging, and public address 
        systems. Solving this research issue would improve train operations' safety and efficiency by allowing train 
        operators to better manage delays and interruptions.<br><br>

        <b>▪ Problem 3: Developing a system to prevent collisions between trains and vehicles at railway crossings<br><br></b>

        Railway crossings are critical points in train operations where vehicles and trains often intersect, and collisions 
        at these intersections can have catastrophic consequences. Detecting and preventing collisions between trains 
        and vehicles at railway crossings is, therefore, another crucial research problem that needs to be addressed to 
        improve train tracking and detection systems.<br><br>

        To address this research problem, researchers need to develop accurate and reliable detection technologies that 
        can detect and notify train operators of vehicles or pedestrians at railway crossings. In addition to detection 
        technologies, research is also needed to develop effective collision prevention systems that can prevent collisions 
        between trains and vehicles at railway crossings. These systems could incorporate automated warning systems, 
        such as visual and auditory alarms, that notify cars and pedestrians of an oncoming train. Solving this research 
        issue would improve train operations greatly and lessen the likelihood of incidents between trains and cars at 
        railway crossings. This will serve to protect the lives and property of those who live and work near railway 
        crossings while also improving overall train safety and efficiency.
        Conclusion:
