        <h1> Literature Survey </h1>

    <p class = "Paragraph3"> Railway transportation has been a crucial mode of transportation for many years, and it continues to play a vital 
        role in the global economy. However, with the increase in train traffic and the complexity of the railway network, 
        there has been a growing concern about the safety of railway crossings. <br><br>
        Railway crossings are places where rail tracks intersect with roadways or pedestrian walkways. These crossings 
        are vulnerable to accidents, especially when drivers or pedestrians are not aware of the presence of a train. In 
        many cases, accidents occur due to the presence of blind spots on trains, which make it difficult for drivers to 
        see obstacles or hazards at railway crossings. <br><br>
        Traditionally, safety measures at railway crossings have focused on the installation of warning signs, lights, and 
        barriers. However, these measures have proven to be inadequate, and accidents at railway crossings continue to 
        occur. To address this issue, there is a need for innovative technologies that can enhance safety measures at 
        railway crossings. <br><br>
        Advancements in technology have enabled the development of sophisticated systems that can enhance railway 
        safety. The use of IoT devices and GSM trackers in the railway industry has been gaining popularity in recent 
        years. IoT devices can provide real-time data on train movements, enabling railway personnel to monitor train 
        traffic and respond quickly to any potential hazards. GSM trackers can provide accurate data on train movements, 
        enabling railway operators to optimize their operations and improve the efficiency of railway transportation. 
        The proposed system that utilizes GSM trackers on trains and IoT devices at railway crossings to predict and 
        alert potential blind spots on the train is an innovative solution to enhance railway safety. The system's predictive 
        capabilities and real-time tracking of trains can help prevent accidents by alerting railway personnel of potential 
        blind spots in advance. This system has the potential to revolutionize the railway industry by making it safer and 
        more efficient, and it is a significant step towards achieving the goal of zero accidents at railway crossings. 
        The use of advanced technologies such as GSM trackers and IoT devices in the railway industry has been the 
        subject of several studies in recent years. Researchers have explored the potential of these technologies to 
        enhance railway safety and improve the efficiency of railway transportation. <br><br>
        One study conducted by Li et al. (2019) focused on the use of IoT devices to enhance railway safety [5]. The 
        study proposed a system that utilized IoT devices to collect data on train movements and transmit it to a central 
        server for analysis. The system was designed to provide real-time updates on train movements and alert railway 
        personnel of any potential hazards. The study concluded that the use of IoT devices could significantly enhance 
        railway safety by providing accurate data on train movements. <br><br>
        Another study conducted by Zhang et al. (2020) focused on the use of machine learning algorithms to predict 
        potential hazards at railway crossings [6]. The study utilized data from IoT devices at railway crossings and 
        combined it with data on train movements from GSM trackers. The study concluded that the use of machine 
        learning algorithms could improve the accuracy of hazard prediction at railway crossings. <br><br>
        The use of GSM trackers to monitor train movements has also been the subject of several studies. One study 
        conducted by Manoharan et al. (2018) focused on the use of GSM trackers to optimize railway transportation 
        [7]. The study proposed a system that utilized GSM trackers to provide real- time data on train movements, 
        enabling railway operators to optimize their operations and improve the efficiency of railway transportation.<br><br><br><br>

        The study by A. A. T. P. De Silva University of Colombo School of Computing [11] has introduced a Real-time 
location based crowdsourcing train tracking android application to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of 
public train transportation. The proposed application is developed by combining Global Positioning System 
(GPS), mobile computing, and crowdsourcing technologies to gain information from the passengers and provide 
visual positioning using Google map in real-time. Additionally, it predicts the estimated time to arrival (ETA) 
of a train to any given railway station for better user experience and for better admin management.<br><br>

The study [12] introduces a method to detect the train using a vibration sensor on the railway track. The Arduino 
microcontroller was chosen to detect the train and send the signal to the level crossing subsystem (LCS) as it has 
enough input lines to connect the relevant sensors and actuators. An alarm system with lights is used with an IoT 
system that consists of Radio Frequency (RF) receiver, Raspberry Pi Model 3 and cameras.<br><br>

“Evaluation of Safety Degree at Railway Crossings in Order to Achieve Sustainable Traffic Management: A 
Novel Integrated Fuzzy MCDM Model” is a research done in 2021 by Aleksandar Blagojević, Sandra Kasalica, 
Željko Stević, Goran Tričković and Vesna Pavelkić. [13] They have done a research to address railway crossings 
collisions by measuring the analysis of safety degree on some railway crossings. They have used some 
mathematical formulas to count this analysis of safety degree.<br><br>

“Traffic Signal Operations Near Highway-Rail Grade Crossings” [14] is a another research done in USA by 
Transportation Research Board and National Research Council in 1999. They mainly focused on the alarm and 
alert systems in the railway crossings. It’s an automatic railway crossing safety system that means, when a train 
is approaching, automatically safety options near the railway crossings like alarms, red lights are activated.
“An Automatic Railway Level Crossing System with Crack Detection” is another research done to minimize the 
collisions in the railway crossings. [15] This researched have used IoT devices like microcontrollers, Ultra Sonic 
Sensors, GSM Modules to detect cracks and barrier control when a train is approaching. GSM module is used to 
send alert messages to relevant authorities when a crack is detected. It is said that this system have a high 
accuracy of 93% reliability of crack detection. And also they send alerts of railway crossings gates and alarm 
status like whether they are on or off when a train is approaching to the relevant authorities.<br><br>

The studies [16] and [17] have used IoT-based systems to automate railway crossings safety system controls. In 
the [16] system, Train current location information is sent to users with a link to see the current location of the 
train via SMS in this system. Arduino Uno, server motors, and sonar sensors have been utilized to implement 
the automated railway crossings bars in this system. In the [17] system, manually operated railway crossing gates 
are transformed into a fully automatic system operated through wirelessly by the stationmaster using Arduino 
Uno and ultrasonic sensors. And, this particular system detects the number of persons and vehicles that remain 
on the tracks after closing of gates by the help of Open-Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) with a buzzer 
and LED bulb connected to it to give alerts during opening and closing of gates.<br><br>

“RDMNS.LK” is a Sri Lankan-developed mobile application to alert railway alerts in Sri Lanka. [18] This 
application shows the users the live locations of the trains when a train is approaching. And also, this app alerts 
the user whether trains are delayed or not and if the train is delayed, how much time the train is delayed. This 
app also shows us train station contact numbers, ticket prices from Colombo Fort and so many more details 
related to trains in Sri Lanka. This application is available for both Android and IOS currently.<br><br>

“Smart Railway Crossing Surveillance System” is another research project done to address railway crossings 
collisions. [19] This system addressed railway collisions by displaying whether the railway gate is opened or 
closed based on the train passing, the most recent gate closure timestamp, and each time when the gate is closed, 
a centralized platform for knowing the condition of the gate, traffic density, and intrusion detection near the 
railway gate. Based on the experimental results, this automated railway crossing assistance outperformed human assisted railway crossings, resulting in an efficient and cost-effective solution for traffic regulation and avoidance 
of accidents at railway gates. They have used an Arduino IoT system for this system as well.<br><br>

The study [20] aimed to aware the train driver about what is blocking the railway path and automatically suggest 
him to follow safety procedures. And also, the other thing focused on is preventing accidents in wildlife areas in 
railway areas in Sri Lanka. Also, to create an inter-connected smart grid to provide real-time train movement 
tracking across the country and make way to insert an AI system to automate entire train operations. An IoT 
system has been utilized to identify train movements and some formulas have been used to calculate some 
calculations.<br><br>

The literature survey highlights several research studies related to the safety of railway crossings. Researchers 
have proposed various solutions, including mathematical models to evaluate the safety degree of railway 
crossings, automatic safety systems activated by approaching trains, IoT- based systems for crack detection and 
barrier control, mobile applications to alert users about train locations and delays, and smart surveillance systems 
to monitor railway gates and traffic density. These studies provide valuable insights into addressing railway 
crossing collisions and can help inform the development of effective safety measures.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Systems for tracking and detecting trains are essential for ensuring the safety and efficiency of train operations. 
These systems rely on a variety of technologies, such as GPS, radar, and other sensors, to track and detect trains 
as they travel along railway lines. With real-time information about train locations and schedules, train operators 
can control traffic and prevent crashes, making these systems critical components of modern transportation 
infrastructure.<br><br>
A train tracking system typically consists of a network of sensors and communication devices that enable real time monitoring of train locations, speeds, and other important operational parameters. However, the security of 
these systems is also essential to ensure their safety and reliability. A security analysis of train tracking systems 
can help identify vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors, assess the potential impact of a security breach on 
the system and its users, and identify ways to mitigate security risks.<br><br>
There are several potential security threats to train tracking systems that should be considered during security 
analysis. Malicious actors may attempt to gain unauthorized access to the system or its data through hacking or 
social engineering attacks. Physical attacks, such as vandalism or sabotage of the system's infrastructure, can 
also pose a significant threat. Denial of service (DoS) attacks, which overwhelm the system's sensors or 
communication devices, can also disrupt operations. Insider threats, such as employees with access to the system 
who may misuse their privileges or engage in malicious behavior, should also be considered.
To mitigate security risks, it is important to implement appropriate security controls and procedures. This may 
include access controls to limit who can access the system and its data, encryption to protect data in transit and 
at rest, and regular security audits and testing to identify vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors. It is also 
important to have a plan in place for responding to security incidents, such as a breach or attack, to minimize 
their impact and prevent further damage.<br><br>
When designing a train monitoring and detection smartphone application, it is crucial to consider privacy and 
security concerns. These applications may collect critical information about train schedules, positions, and 
freight, making it essential to provide safe and private systems that safeguard user data and guarantee the security 
of train operations. This may include implementing secure data storage and transmission protocols, as well as p
The development of alarm and tracking systems for trains has closely mirrored technological improvements. The 
widespread installation of telegraph lines alongside railway tracks in the late 19th century made it possible for 
railway staff and the central dispatching office to communicate more effectively. This was a significant step in 
the direction of centralised management and coordination.
Additional technological developments, such as the use of computers for train dispatching and signalling, 
occurred in the later half of the 20th century. More effective resource allocation and train scheduling were made 
possible by computerised systems. Additionally, the use of GPS technology offered a revolutionary method for 
real-time train tracking by delivering accurate, satellite-based location data.
Due to the fusion of mobile technology, wireless connectivity, and data analytics, train tracking and alarm 
systems have rapidly advanced in the twenty-first century. As a result of these advancements, sophisticated 
systems that offer real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and proactive alarms have emerged, revolutionising 
the railway sector.<br><br>
In order to provide very accurate location data, modern train tracking and alarm systems use GPS technology, 
cellphone networks, and onboard sensors. Real-time updates on train arrivals, departures, and delays are 
provided by passenger-focused mobile applications, revolutionising the passenger experience and raising general 
happiness.<br><br>
Train operations now heavily rely on predictive analytics, which is backed by machine learning and data 
analytics. By taking into account elements like weather, maintenance schedules, and previous data, these systems 
are able to anticipate future disruptions. Operators may improve operating efficiency, optimise schedules, and 
cut down on delays thanks to this predictive capability.
In the case of emergencies or unanticipated problems, alert mechanisms inside these systems ensure prompt 
contact with train operators, maintenance teams, and passengers. By giving key information to stakeholders, this 
proactive strategy not only improves safety but also enables quick and coordinated reactions to incidents, 
minimising the impact on both operational effectiveness and safety.
As a result of tremendous development from their modest beginnings, train tracking and alarm systems have 
transformed into crucial tools in the modern railway business. These systems are prepared to play an increasingly 
more crucial role in maintaining the sustainability, effectiveness, and safety of rail transport as technology 
develops, helping to determine the course of this important method of transport in the future.
Significant technological advancements in train tracking were made during the 20th century. Rail operations 
were optimised by the introduction of centralised traffic control systems that allowed for remote control of 
signals and switches. By reducing crashes and permitting accurate tracking of train locations, track circuits—
which could identify the presence of trains on a track section—improved safety. Providing clear and transparent 
privacy policies and user agreements. <br><br>
In conclusion, train tracking systems are critical components of modern transportation infrastructure, and 
security analysis is an essential component of their operation. By identifying and mitigating potential security 
risks, we can ensure the safety and reliability of these critical transportation systems. Additionally, when 
designing train monitoring and detection smartphone applications, privacy and security concerns must be 
carefully considered to protect user data and guarantee the security of train operations.<br>
